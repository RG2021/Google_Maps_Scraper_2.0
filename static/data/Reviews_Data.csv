ChIJiS0q_IUbDTkRne1DLBh2874,·¥Ö…™…¢·¥†…™·¥ä·¥Ä è,"The airport was operated by the Indian Air Force before its management was transferred to the Airports Authority of India.[11] In May 2006, the management of the airport was passed over to Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL), a consortium led by the GMR Group.[12] In September 2008, the airport inaugurated a 4,430 m (14,530 ft) runway. With the commencement of operations at Terminal 3 in 2010, it became India's and South Asia's largest aviation hub. The Terminal 3 building has a capacity to handle 34 million passengers annually and is the world's 8th largest passenger terminal.[6] The airport uses an advanced system called Airport Collaborative Decision Making (A-CDM) to help keep takeoffs and landings  timely and predictable.In 2010, IGIA was conferred the fourth best airport award in the world in the 15‚Äì25 million category, and Best Improved Airport in the Asia-Pacific Region by Airports Council International.The airport was rated as the Best airport in the world in the 25‚Äì40  million passengers category in 2015, by Airports Council International.Delhi Airport was awarded The Best Airport in Central Asia and Best Airport Staff in Central Asia at the Skytrax World Airport Awards 2015.[17] IGI also stood first in the new rankings for 2015 Airport Service Quality (ASQ) Awards conducted by Airports Council International. The airport, along with Mumbai Airport was adjudged ""World's Best Airport"" at Airport Service Quality Awards 2017 in the highest category of airports handling more than 40 million passengers annually.The other airport serving Delhi NCR is Hindon Airport which is much smaller in size and primarily handles regional flights out of the city under the government's UDAN. Safdarjung Airport is used mainly by VVIP helicopters and small charter helicopters due to its short runway. Jewar Airport is being planned to offset the load of Indira Gandhi International Airport.Safdarjung Airport was built in 1930 and was the main airport for Delhi until 1962.Due to increasing passenger traffic at Safdarjung, civilian operations were moved to Palam Airport (later renamed to IGIA) in 1962.Palam Airport had been built during World War II as RAF Station Palam and after the British left, it served as an Air Force Station for the Indian Air Force. Palam Airport had a peak capacity of around 1,300 passengers per hour.[4] In 1979-80, a total of 3 million domestic and international passengers flew into and out of Palam Airport.Owing to an increase in air traffic in the 70s and the 80's, an additional terminal with nearly four times the area of the old Palam terminal was constructed. With the inauguration of this new international terminal, Terminal 2, on 2 May 1986, the airport was renamed as Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA).The old domestic airport (Palam) is known as Terminal 1 and was divided into separate buildings- 1A, 1B, and 1C. Blocks 1A and 1B used to handle international operations while domestic operations took place in 1C. Today, block 1A became a dedicated terminal for state-run Air India, which is now demolished. Block 1B was used by all private commercial airlines, which is also demolished. Block 1C was turned into a domestic arrivals-only terminal, and the newly constructed domestic departure block 1D is now used by all domestic low-cost airlines (GoAir, IndiGo, SpiceJet). There is also a separate Technical Area for VVIP passengers.
Significant growth in Indian aviation industry led to a major increase in passenger traffic. The capacity of Terminal 1 was estimated to be 7.15 million passengers per annum (mppa). Actual throughput for 2005/06 was an estimated 10.4 million passengers. Including the closed down international terminal (Terminal 2), the airport had a total capacity of 12.5 million passengers per year, whereas the total passenger traffic in 2006/07 was 16.5 million passengers per year.In 2008, total passenger count at the airport reached 23.97 million. In order to ease the traffic congestion on the existing terminals,The airport was operated by the Indian Air Force before its management...",3 weeks ago, 5 stars 
ChIJiS0q_IUbDTkRne1DLBh2874,Srimanta Saren,"Indira Gandhi International Airport (IATA: DEL, ICAO: VIDP) serves as the major international aviation hub of the Indian capital city of New Delhi as well as India. The airport, spread over an area of 5,106 acres (2,066 ha), is situated in Palam, 15 km (9.3 mi) south-west of the New Delhi railway station and 16 km (9.9 mi) from New Delhi city centre. Named after former Prime Minister of India Indira Gandhi, it is the busiest airport in India in terms of passenger traffic since 2009. It is also the busiest airport in the country in terms of cargo traffic, overtaking Mumbai during late 2015. In the calendar year 2018, it was the 12th busiest airport in the world and 6th busiest airport in Asia by passenger traffic handling nearly 70 million passengers. It is the world's busiest airport for Airbus A320 aircraft.

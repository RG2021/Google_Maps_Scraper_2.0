ChIJiS0q_IUbDTkRne1DLBh2874,·¥Ö…™…¢·¥†…™·¥ä·¥Ä è,"The airport was operated by the Indian Air Force before its management was transferred to the Airports Authority of India.[11] In May 2006, the management of the airport was passed over to Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL), a consortium led by the GMR Group.[12] In September 2008, the airport inaugurated a 4,430 m (14,530 ft) runway. With the commencement of operations at Terminal 3 in 2010, it became India's and South Asia's largest aviation hub. The Terminal 3 building has a capacity to handle 34 million passengers annually and is the world's 8th largest passenger terminal.[6] The airport uses an advanced system called Airport Collaborative Decision Making (A-CDM) to help keep takeoffs and landings  timely and predictable.In 2010, IGIA was conferred the fourth best airport award in the world in the 15‚Äì25 million category, and Best Improved Airport in the Asia-Pacific Region by Airports Council International.The airport was rated as the Best airport in the world in the 25‚Äì40  million passengers category in 2015, by Airports Council International.Delhi Airport was awarded The Best Airport in Central Asia and Best Airport Staff in Central Asia at the Skytrax World Airport Awards 2015.[17] IGI also stood first in the new rankings for 2015 Airport Service Quality (ASQ) Awards conducted by Airports Council International. The airport, along with Mumbai Airport was adjudged ""World's Best Airport"" at Airport Service Quality Awards 2017 in the highest category of airports handling more than 40 million passengers annually.The other airport serving Delhi NCR is Hindon Airport which is much smaller in size and primarily handles regional flights out of the city under the government's UDAN. Safdarjung Airport is used mainly by VVIP helicopters and small charter helicopters due to its short runway. Jewar Airport is being planned to offset the load of Indira Gandhi International Airport.Safdarjung Airport was built in 1930 and was the main airport for Delhi until 1962.Due to increasing passenger traffic at Safdarjung, civilian operations were moved to Palam Airport (later renamed to IGIA) in 1962.Palam Airport had been built during World War II as RAF Station Palam and after the British left, it served as an Air Force Station for the Indian Air Force. Palam Airport had a peak capacity of around 1,300 passengers per hour.[4] In 1979-80, a total of 3 million domestic and international passengers flew into and out of Palam Airport.Owing to an increase in air traffic in the 70s and the 80's, an additional terminal with nearly four times the area of the old Palam terminal was constructed. With the inauguration of this new international terminal, Terminal 2, on 2 May 1986, the airport was renamed as Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA).The old domestic airport (Palam) is known as Terminal 1 and was divided into separate buildings- 1A, 1B, and 1C. Blocks 1A and 1B used to handle international operations while domestic operations took place in 1C. Today, block 1A became a dedicated terminal for state-run Air India, which is now demolished. Block 1B was used by all private commercial airlines, which is also demolished. Block 1C was turned into a domestic arrivals-only terminal, and the newly constructed domestic departure block 1D is now used by all domestic low-cost airlines (GoAir, IndiGo, SpiceJet). There is also a separate Technical Area for VVIP passengers.
Significant growth in Indian aviation industry led to a major increase in passenger traffic. The capacity of Terminal 1 was estimated to be 7.15 million passengers per annum (mppa). Actual throughput for 2005/06 was an estimated 10.4 million passengers. Including the closed down international terminal (Terminal 2), the airport had a total capacity of 12.5 million passengers per year, whereas the total passenger traffic in 2006/07 was 16.5 million passengers per year.In 2008, total passenger count at the airport reached 23.97 million. In order to ease the traffic congestion on the existing terminals,The airport was operated by the Indian Air Force before its management...",3 weeks ago, 5 stars 
ChIJiS0q_IUbDTkRne1DLBh2874,Srimanta Saren,"Indira Gandhi International Airport (IATA: DEL, ICAO: VIDP) serves as the major international aviation hub of the Indian capital city of New Delhi as well as India. The airport, spread over an area of 5,106 acres (2,066 ha), is situated in Palam, 15 km (9.3 mi) south-west of the New Delhi railway station and 16 km (9.9 mi) from New Delhi city centre. Named after former Prime Minister of India Indira Gandhi, it is the busiest airport in India in terms of passenger traffic since 2009. It is also the busiest airport in the country in terms of cargo traffic, overtaking Mumbai during late 2015. In the calendar year 2018, it was the 12th busiest airport in the world and 6th busiest airport in Asia by passenger traffic handling nearly 70 million passengers.

ChIJO87U12kUrjsRNiANLOxsCdo,LaFilleChic,"Me and three of my girlfriends went to BREAKOUT ESCAPE ROOMS one sunday evening hoping for a new experience because mostly Bangalore is all about dining out and partying (as you know there is no shortage of those in the city). And a new adventure is exactly what we got. 

In case you don't know what you do in an Escape room, basically you and your team are locked inside a ROOM for a set time. In that time you are assigned a task to complete and then break out of the room. In our case, the task was to save a little girl who got kidnapped, find the culprits and then find the code to get out of the space in 60 mins before the virtual BOMB goes off and we all virtually die.

I wish I could write all that we had to do inside to achieve that, but alas, I don't want to give any spoilers and ruin your fun! All I would say though is that we found the girl and identified the culprits but unfortunately couldn't get out of the room in time. Nevertheless, all four of us had an amazing time playing detectives half the time and being goofy the other half. I think this is a great bonding and team building activity because you got to coordinate with your teammates. This was our first time ever in an escape room so the experience was even more memorable and unique for us.

ChIJO87U12kUrjsRNiANLOxsCdo,Jharna Kukreja,"Had a great day at Breakout Escape Rooms with my kids. They played the Enchanted forest game. In their game they had to hunt for treasures in a forest in order to save the famine hit people of a fictional Kingdom. It was a surreal and unique experience for the both of them.

I had the chance to participate in a game called ‚ÄòCurse of the Pharaoh‚Äô where we pretended to be a group of archeologists that had to hunt for artifacts in Egypt, discover a secret tomb, restore the reputation of a famous archaeologist and uncurse the Pharaoh before the place is destroyed. It was an adventure and I had a serious adrenaline rush and thrill trying to solve the mystery.

All we wanted was an experience, and they have done it very well. We took the ""Kidnapped Mystery"" which indeed has a lot of distractions as well as tricky puzzles.
Its actually puzzles built in a chain where you have to start at one end and solve your way through to get to the mystery and escape the room, do not forget to take note if the story clues that they have hidden all over the place.
However it is a one time experience, i might suggest it to people who have never been to such kind of place, or if you enjoy solving a lot of puzzles, you may visit this place with all its themes, as well as many similar breakout rooms in the city.
Its a good place for teambuilding, recreation and spending some money on some spooky experience.

Some scary and creepy moments for the kids but that was also fun.
I felt it was a bit on the expensive side at Rs 500 per person. For that price I expected really engrossing A/V effects and a much better ambience matching the game play. For what is available a fairer price would be about Rs 300-350. The spaces are a bit small. Staff is very courteous and helpful.

ChIJ74XAbuL8DDkR-wJQ-vQyHkQ,Sourav Bhadra,"We went to the Red Fort as part of our Delhi City and highlights tour. It is a UNESCO World Heritage site and is an impressive building. It is a very large walled Fort - 2.5km around the battlements.
Others on the site have commented that foreign tourists pay much more than locals for entrance but that is quite normal in India and be prepared for men and women to enter separately and to be searched.
The monument is occupied mainly by the military and the armed guards are very obvious and initially made me look twice. There are also numerous protective metal 'shields' in very visible locations. We were told that this is all due to the situation with Pakistan - we had not expected it and made us feel a bit on edge.
Once inside the gates there is an arcade that is full of 'merchants' - this is not a good place to buy!! There are numerous other celebratory buildings within the walls.
This is a large 'site' and you need to be realistic in the amount of time you want to spend here. Our guide suggested no more than two hours and it is easy to go into overload here.",a month ago, 5 stars

It was first inaugurated in the year 1931 and it still has the same charm. Also, this structure reminds of us the sacrifices made by thousands of soldiers who have given their lives during the first world war. The essay on India gate is an insight into this famous memorial in India. 
Whenever someone visits Delhi, they never miss the India gate. Thus, it has become one of the integral parts of Delhi and also a major tourist attraction. The locals as well as the tourists coming to visit Delhi flock this place all around the year. Also, for many locals, the sprawling lawns around the gate on both sides is a nice picnic spot. 

It is very easy to reach the India gate as it is located centrally. Also, for winters, people pack their lunch and head to India gate along with their friends and families to spend the quality time.

ChIJ74XAbuL8DDkR-wJQ-vQyHkQ,Sahil Garg,"You must visit this place for SURE. It's very well maintained and very beautiful from inside too, not just outside. Do visit the museums inside (it has an extra ticket for that), that are well detailed and maintained. Walk all the way inside for the nice architecture... You can click a lot of good pics too. There is a market inside, but I felt the prices were higher than that of outside, so better not buy or bargain well. You'll at least need an hour to go through everything in there.",3 months ago, 5 stars

ChIJ74XAbuL8DDkR-wJQ-vQyHkQ,Kumar Prince,"Better to pay via an app, rather than at the pay-booths, which seem to be around a kilometre away from the real entrance !

Overseas tourists pay around ten times the entrance fee of Indian nationals ! Is that welcoming ?

Take plenty of drinking water with you, as there is much ground to cover, within the walls, with many separate buildings and pavilions to view ! Squirrels and well-fed stray dogs appear to co-habit, peacefully, too !

The traders, inside, close to the entrance/exit, are ruthless at exploiting the most casual of interest - especially when they see you are hot and tired, and about to leave !

You can easily spend 2 to 3 hours, here, and there are plenty of stone seats, (or low flat-topped walls ?) to rest tired limbs !

Take your cameras !",2 months ago, 5 stars

Be sure to be enthralled by bits of history every direction you look. 

I would recommend taking an audio guide from the entrance. It's value for money and you can always repeat and go at your own pace. 

The museums have more of storytelling value than actual exhibits. But recommended nonetheless.",3 months ago, 5 stars

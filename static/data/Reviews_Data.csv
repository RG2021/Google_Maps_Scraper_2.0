Its a self service joint and food is good without doubt. A bit crowded at times otherwise its a good place to ha e snacks, meals and specially made seasonal food.",5 months ago, 4 stars 
ChIJowswABv9DDkRlIwWegNm4LA,chandni kaur,"Came here in 2015 and it was very good then. Came back again now in 2020 and its terrible. The staff look absolutely careless and they are SO forgetful when you go to order. The service is absolutely slow, my appetite vanished because of the wait. It's extremely busy and there's barely any space to sit and eat. I ordered good amount of food and half of it was stone cold. My parents disliked it so much and even questioned if this was the place I came to couple of years ago. Do not like it at all and won't go back",3 months ago, 2 stars 
ChIJowswABv9DDkRlIwWegNm4LA,Madhavi Latha,"Nice Restaurant overall. We wanted a good restaurant to have a lunch. This did serve the purpose with great food. Nice and good taste of food. Is good for having lunch. We were traveling, so we're in a hurry. But this place is quick enough when serving an order. There are many restaurants which take a lot of time to serve food of. According to my experience, this was OK when compared to the others( not nearby this, I'm generally speaking).",6 months ago, 4 stars

ChIJowswABv9DDkRlIwWegNm4LA,harshit sultania,This haldiram outlet is small but very attractive. The interior is good. However being haldiram .. means a lot of customers..i.e why you might find some trouble finding a seat on peak days. The menu is very good. The staffs are very cooperative. PS - u won't find hand made lassi here. Thankyou very much,2 months ago, 5 stars

ChIJowswABv9DDkRlIwWegNm4LA,Rahul Nair,"Awesome food, but what a terrible road!! Was under construction when we last visitee. Now, I loved the Thalis we got packed for our train dinner, but when in Delhi look for options. I mean c'mon you're in Delhi, not just the capital of India but the capital of street food. Well this place is hygienic, has lovely taste and variety. No doubt. But it is always heavily crowded,  priced much higher than usual outlets in Delhi. Agreed its a brand name, but pricing could have been more competitive. All the best anyways, and the food was great!",3 months ago, 3 stars
